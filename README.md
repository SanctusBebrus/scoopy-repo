SCOOPy is a small chat project based on working with python libraries like "socket" and "PyQT5".

If you want to run it on your computer, you should:
1) run the "Server.py" file. This way you will create the server to work with.
2) run the "scoopy_client" file to show the GUI and make the connection to the server.
3) enjoy this small chat
